title: Shadow About

<h1>Mission</h1>
Shadow was developed because there was a recognized need for an accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for Tor experimentation. PlanetLab is undesirable due to management overhead and lack of control, existing emulators are far too inefficient when scaling to thousands of nodes, and roll-your-own simulators are far too inaccurate and generic (not to mention unmaintained) to be useful for multiple projects. Experiments on the live Tor network are often infeasible due to privacy risks.

Our goal is to provide a tool that can be used by anyone with a Linux machine or access to EC2 so that research prototypes can be built much faster and the time to deployment in real software can be reduced.
