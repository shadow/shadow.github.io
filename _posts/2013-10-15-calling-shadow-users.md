Hello Shadow users!

I would like to build a list of Shadow's users (organizations/projects and/or individuals) to add to the "User" section of the Shadow "about" webpage. Some examples can be found here:  
[http://shadow.github.io/about/](http://shadow.github.io/about/)

If you are a Shadow user and are willing to identify yourself as such, please email shadow-support-owner at cs.umn.edu with the following information:

  + Name of organization or user
  + Website, project, or lab name
  + Website, project, or lab URL

Please note that this information is useful to me even if you prefer I do not share it publicly, but please indicate if you want this information kept private.

Thanks and happy simulating!
